This weapon fires low-velocity .45 ACP bullets with exceptional stopping power against unarmored/light armored targets, but demonstrates poor penetration performance against medium armor and becomes nearly ineffective versus heavy armor.
With high cyclic rate and noticeable recoil impulse, controlling sustained bursts requires considerable skill. Increasing automatic weapons proficiency marginally improves stability during short/long bursts, allowing more bullets to stay on target.

@6221 = "The world's first truly automatic firearm powered by gas operation made its bloody debut in WWI's Somme Offensive, where German units used it to claim 60,000 British lives in a single day - essentially inventing industrialized warfare. Nicknamed 'The Reaper's Lawnmower', this water-cooled behemoth traded portability for relentless fire. While its tripod stability and steady rate of fire made it a trench warfare superstar, soldiers joked that operating it required 'three men to carry, four more to feed it ammo, and a priest to pray the belt doesn't jam'.
This weapon fires 7.7mm full-power bullets with superior penetration against heavier armor, while prone to over-penetration vs unarmored targets.
Mounted on its tripod fortress, firing stability is absolute - no automatic weapons proficiency bonuses apply.

Armorers quip: 'Maintenance requires three things - a wrench, a prayer, and selective memory about its 1921 birth certificate'. With ballistics flatter than Kansas and recoil management smoother than jazz, its only weakness is sounding like grandma's sewing machine when firing.
Firing 12.7mm bullets that turn cover into confetti, this weapon devastates all armor types including constructs/large creatures.

@6123 = "M134 Minigun"
@6223 = "The M134 uses an electric motor to drive the rotation of six barrels, enabling it to spew a metal storm at a rate of thousands of rounds per minute, shredding targets into pieces. This also results in significant drawbacks: excessive ammunition consumption and barrels prone to overheating. Although the weapon boasts an extremely low malfunction rate, its complex structure makes timely troubleshooting difficult once malfunctions occur. While the gun itself is relatively compact and lightweight, its accompanying external power supply, control system, ammunition storage and feeding systems are notably bulky, severely limiting its operational versatility. Even if batteries and ammunition are placed on the ground to reduce weight, the recoil force exceeding 150 kilograms during high-rate firing becomes unbearable. Therefore, when modified into a handheld version, the weapon's firing rate is adjusted downward accordingly.
Firing 7.62mm bullets with armor-piercing enthusiasm, prone to over-penetration vs light/unarmored targets.
